!!! Unlocking a piece of equipment can trigger a chain reaction,
    achieving a special effect with another piece of equipment.

Multi-element attribute synergy:
 e.g., Water + Lightning = AOE, linking enemies within the electric shock range.

1. Core Offense Props

1.1. Piercing Rounds  √
Effect: Player's Bullets can pass through N enemies, each hit deals full or slightly reduced damage.
Synergy:
Strong with range (bullets travel farther, hit more).
Strong with firerate (more bullets → more multi-hits).
Good vs swarms, slightly weaker vs single bosses.

1.2. Ricochet Scope   √
Effect: When a bullet hits an enemy or wall, it can bounce once toward the nearest enemy if exists.
Synergy:
Works nicely with your obstacles (walls turn into combo tools).
Great with crit (ricochets can crit too).
Encourages fighting near obstacles instead of open fields.

1.3. Bleeding Edge
Effect: Your hits apply a “Bleed” that deals X% of damage over 3s, stacking up to Y times.
Synergy:
High firerate builds become DoT machines.
Good vs high-HP bosses (persistent damage even while kiting).
Can interact with other props: e.g., “Hemorrhage” that increases damage to bleeding targets.

1.4. Shrapnel Shells √
Effect: On enemy death, there is a chance to spawn 3–4 small projectiles in random directions.
Synergy:
Insane in big waves (chain-kill feeling).
More effective with crit (shrapnel can crit).
You can add a prop later that upgrades shrapnel size or count.

1.5. Mark of Vulnerability
Effect: Every X seconds, randomly “mark” an enemy; marked enemies take +20% damage from all sources.
Synergy:
Good vs elite / boss enemies.
Pairs well with range and pierce so you can focus the marked target while hitting others.

2. Defense & Survival Props

Not just raw HP—give them interesting defensive patterns.
2.1. Bone Plating rarity: 2
Effect: Every 6 seconds, gain 2hp plating. Stacks are unlimited (reset each level). Purchase limit 5; once capped, any time you have plating it negates the next hit entirely (consuming one stack even if the damage exceeds the plating).
Synergy:
Strong for beginners / melee risk-takers.
Combos with high speed playstyles (you can dash in to grab coins safely).
2.2. Guardian Charm
Effect: When your HP drops below 30%, gain a temporary shield and +X% speed for 3 seconds. Long cooldown.
Synergy:
Helps “glass cannon” builds survive mistakes.
Synergizes with speed / positioning to escape on low HP.

2.3. Blood Pact
Effect: +X% damage, but max HP reduced by Y%.
Synergy:
Obvious synergy with max HP props and heal mechanics.
Encourages high skill players to take risks.

2.4. Retaliation Thorns
Effect: Enemies that hit you take a flat damage or % of their max HP.
Synergy:
Works well with Bone Plating (you can “intentionally” take occasional hits).
Encourages tanky, lower-mobility builds.

2.5. Aegis Pulse
    Trigger condition
Only active while the player has any shield HP:
player.shield_hp > 0 (biome/domain shields, future shield props)
OR carapace_shield_hp > 0 (your Carapace one-time shield)

Effect

Every X seconds, while shield is present, emit a hexagonal force field centered on the player:
Shape: visually rendered as a hexagon; collision can be:
either a circle in code, and you just draw a hex/oct outline, or


All enemies whose hitbox intersects the field take damage.

3. Economy & Bandit Interaction Props

These are great for your Bandit mechanic and the shop fantasy.

3.1. Lockbox
Effect: A percentage of your coins becomes “protected” and cannot be stolen by bandits.
Synergy:
Great early if bandits are frequent.
Can open up “greedy” builds where you hoard coins instead of spending immediately.

3.2. Wanted Poster
Effect: Bandits take extra damage and drop bonus coins when killed.
Synergy:
Converts the “punishment” enemy into a high-reward target.
Combos with high speed (easier to chase them down) and burst damage.

3.3. Coin Magnet !!!!! √
Effect: Increases coin pickup radius.
Synergy:
Super good with high movement speed, kiting builds.
Makes dangerous coin chasing much safer; good for wave-end cleanup.

3.4. Golden Interest
Effect: At the start of each level, gain +X% of your unspent coins as bonus.
Synergy:
Encourages the player to save coins and forgo instant power.
Works nicely with Lockbox (protect your savings from bandits).

3.5. Bandit Radar
Effect: When a bandit spawns, highlight them and slow them slightly for a short duration.
Synergy:
Combined with Wanted Poster → “Bandit hunter” build.
Fits your current collision volume and aura design (you can show a glowing outline).

4. Utility / Control Props
These change the way the player moves or controls space.

4.1. Time Dilation Boots
Effect: When you stop moving for ≥ 0.5s, enemies in a radius are slightly slowed.
Synergy:
Encourages a “turret” playstyle: stand and shoot.
Good with high firerate and range.
Interesting opposite to normal “run and gun” speed builds.

4.2. Phantom Dash (if you ever add dash / evade)
Effect: Dashing through enemies deals damage and briefly slows them.
Synergy:
Obvious with speed and any dash cooldown reduction.
Very fun for aggressive play around obstacles.

4.3. Sticky Tar Flask
Effect: Occasionally drops a slowing puddle where you stand for a second; enemies in it are slowed and take minor DoT.
Synergy:
Strong near obstacles, choke points.
Works with knockback / push effects if you add them later.

4.4. Auto-Turret Backpack !!!!  √
Effect: Deploys a small turret that follows you and fires weak bullets at nearest enemy.
Synergy:
Scales with damage buffs if turret uses your damage.
Good with any prop that boosts “all sources” damage (e.g., Mark of Vulnerability).

5. Crit, Element, and Synergy Props

These give crit & status builds more identity, especially since you already have crit chance.

5.1. Razor Focus
Effect: +Crit chance, but -Fire rate.
Synergy:
Works on builds that already stacked firerate from level-ups.
High synergy with crit damage multiplier if you add that stat later.

5.2. Explosive Crits
Effect: Critical hits cause a small explosion around the target, dealing splash damage.
Synergy:
Ties together crit + crowd control.
Combos insanely with ricochet / pierce / shrapnel.

5.3. Frost Brand
Effect: Hits have a small chance to “chill” enemies, slowing them briefly. If you hit a chilled enemy again, extra damage.
Synergy:
Strong with high firerate (you can proc chill frequently).
Gives non-speed builds some safety through slows.

5.4. Shock Relay
Effect: Every N-th hit chains lightning to nearby enemy for bonus damage.
Synergy:
Rewards sustained fire (auto-fire weapons).
Great vs clustered waves; weaker vs single boss, so still somewhat balanced.
