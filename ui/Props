!!! Unlocking a piece of equipment can trigger a chain reaction,
    achieving a special effect with another piece of equipment.

Multi-element attribute synergy:
 e.g., Water + Lightning = AOE, linking enemies within the electric shock range.

Ballistic Path has an initial prototype (Pierce / Ricochet / Shrapnel).
Turret Path has the baseline variants (Auto / Stationary).
Shield Path has a working baseline (Carapace + Bone Plating + Shield AOE).
Economy Path has baseline systems (Coin / Coupon / Reroll).

Status Path has baseline systems (Buff / Debuff / Status).
   Leave a trace wherever you go on map, then apply a status effect to enemies in the area.
   Status effect will be removed when you leave the area for a while.
   Status effect will be removed when you die/restart/clear the level.


Summoner Path has baseline systems (Pet / Minion / Summoner).
   Summon a Summoner that follows you and attacks enemies. When the Summoner dies, 
   it will be replaced by a new one. Summoner will level up with you.
   Summoner will have a unique ability that is different from your own.
   Summoner will have a unique passive ability that is different from your own.

Lucky Path has baseline systems (Lucky / Risk / Chance).

Path Detail (Expanded English Design Spec)
1) Ballistic Path
   Fantasy: high projectile mastery and wave-clearing combos.
   Key scaling stats: projectile count, pierce count, ricochet count, projectile speed.
   Signature mechanics: hit chaining, wall-assisted bounces, kill-triggered shrapnel bursts.
   Weakness: can underperform if maps have low enemy density or poor bounce angles.

2) Turret Path
   Fantasy: controlled zone defense with independent damage sources.
   Key scaling stats: turret count, duration, fire rate, lock-on range.
   Signature mechanics: auto turret for tracking, stationary turret for burst zones.
   Weakness: vulnerable to fast reposition encounters and forced movement bosses.

3) Shield Path
   Fantasy: survive pressure and convert defense into controlled retaliation.
   Key scaling stats: shield capacity, recharge, shield-on-hit effects, break effects.
   Signature mechanics: Carapace one-time protection, plating stacks, shield pulse damage.
   Weakness: lower ceiling if player avoids all damage and never triggers shield reactions.

4) Economy Path
   Fantasy: leverage resources to snowball smartly instead of pure combat stats.
   Key scaling stats: coin gain multiplier, shop discount, reroll efficiency, protected coins.
   Signature mechanics: better shop control, safer greed choices, compound value over time.
   Weakness: weak immediate combat power if economy is over-invested too early.

5) Status Path
   Fantasy: control tempo through damage-over-time and debuff layers.
   Key scaling stats: status duration, tick damage, stack cap, application chance.
   Signature mechanics: trail zones, persistent debuffs, area denial through status fields.
   Weakness: slower burst against urgent threats without setup time.

6) Summoner Path
   Fantasy: indirect power through companions and team-style combat flow.
   Key scaling stats: summon count, summon damage ratio, summon uptime, respawn speed.
   Signature mechanics: autonomous minions, command-based focus fire, summon-specific synergies.
   Weakness: AI/pathing downtime can reduce real DPS in cluttered arenas.

7) Lucky Path
   Fantasy: high-variance run shaping with risk-reward decisions.
   Key scaling stats: trigger chance, jackpot multiplier, fail penalty, reroll interaction.
   Signature mechanics: chance-based spikes, gamble props, high ceiling but unstable floor.
   Weakness: can create inconsistent runs without protection mechanics.

Cross-path design rules:
   Every major path should have at least 2 bridge props with two other paths.
   No single path should solve both elite waves and bosses without trade-offs.
   Utility paths (Economy/Status) should become stronger over time, not instantly.
   High-variance paths must include one stabilizer option for consistency.

Path Tuning (Specific Numbers and Formulas)
Global run brackets:
   Early: waves 1-5
   Mid: waves 6-12
   Late: waves 13+

Enemy scaling targets:
   enemy_hp_multiplier = 1.00 / 1.85 / 3.10 (early/mid/late)
   enemy_damage_multiplier = 1.00 / 1.35 / 1.80
   elite_spawn_ratio = 8% / 16% / 24%

Path activation threshold:
   A path is considered "online" when player owns >= 2 tagged props from that path.
   A path is considered "fully online" when player owns >= 4 tagged props from that path.

Ballistic Path numeric targets:
   effective_hit_count = 1 + pierce_count + (ricochet_count * 0.60)
   shrapnel_proc_chance_cap = 55%
   projectile_count_soft_cap = +4 (extra projectiles after cap get 50% damage)
   target DPS gain from online to fully online: +35% to +55%

Turret Path numeric targets:
   max_active_turrets = 1 / 2 / 3 (by progression tier)
   turret_damage_ratio_vs_player = 0.45 / 0.55 / 0.65
   turret_duration = 8s base, +1.5s per level, cap 16s
   retarget_interval = 0.25s (do not set lower to avoid visual jitter)

Shield Path numeric targets:
   shield_hp_gain_per_pick = +12 / +18 / +25
   shield_recharge_delay = 5.0s base, minimum 2.5s
   shield_break_explosion_ratio = 0.35 * player_bullet_base
   max_total_shield_from_props = 220 (before temporary buffs)

Economy Path numeric targets:
   coin_gain_bonus_per_level = +8% (cap +56%)
   shop_discount_per_level = 4% (cap 20%)
   reroll_cost_growth = +1 coin per reroll, cap 12
   no-combat-investment safety rule: if DPS is below threshold, offer one combat-biased shop slot

Status Path numeric targets:
   base_status_apply_chance = 18% / 24% / 30%
   status_duration_bonus_per_level = +0.4s (cap +2.4s)
   dot_tick_interval = 0.5s fixed for readability
   max_parallel_damage_statuses_on_single_target = 3

Summoner Path numeric targets:
   summon_count_base = 1, hard_cap = 3
   summon_damage_ratio = 0.35 / 0.45 / 0.55 (early/mid/late)
   summon_hp_ratio_vs_player = 0.60 / 0.80 / 1.00
   summon_crit_inherit = min(player_crit * 0.40, 35%)
   summon_fire_rate_inherit = min(player_fire_rate_bonus * 0.50, +80%)
   summon_respawn_time = 6.0s base, floor 2.5s
   boss_damage_penalty_default = -25% unless overridden by summon-specialized props

Lucky Path numeric targets:
   high-roll_trigger_chance = 12% base, cap 35%
   fail_penalty_limit = not more than -20% effective run DPS at full stack
   expected_value_rule: over 10 encounters, Lucky path should be +5% to +12% average value
   variance rule: standard deviation should stay below "one shop purchase equivalent" per wave

Summoner AI and Command Specifics
Command inputs:
   Focus command cooldown = 8s, duration = 4s, bonus damage during focus = +20%
   Regroup command cooldown = 6s, forces summons to orbit player for 2.5s
   Hold Position command cooldown = 10s, hold radius = 1.5 tiles, duration = 5s

AI movement tuning:
   follow_distance = 1.2 tiles
   leash_break_distance = 5.0 tiles
   teleport_back_delay_when_leash_broken = 1.0s
   avoid_overlap_separation_radius = 0.55 tiles

AI target scoring:
   score = (threat_weight * enemy_threat) + (distance_weight / distance) + mark_bonus
   recommended weights: threat_weight = 0.6, distance_weight = 0.3, mark_bonus = 0.4
   forced retarget if current target is unreachable for > 0.75s

Summoner branch progression breakpoints:
   Level 1-2: baseline summon only, no branch passive
   Level 3: choose branch (Swarm Commander / Arcane Familiar / Warden Totem)
   Level 6: unlock branch active skill modifier
   Level 9: unlock branch capstone passive
   Level 10+: only horizontal growth (utility/consistency), no major raw DPS spike

Summoner Path Build (Design Draft)
Core identity:
   Lower direct burst from player; higher map control and sustained team DPS through summons.

Core rules:
   Base max summons: 1. Hard cap: 3 (only through rare props/upgrades).
   Summon base damage scales from player bullet_base at a reduced ratio.
   Suggested ratio by tier: 35% / 45% / 55% (early/mid/late unlock tiers).
   Summon crit chance inherits 40% of player crit chance (capped at 35%).
   Summon attack speed inherits 50% of player fire rate bonuses (capped).
   Respawn delay after summon death: 6.0s base, can be reduced to minimum 2.5s.

AI behavior package:
   Default: follow player at medium leash distance.
   In combat: prioritize marked/high-threat enemies first.
   Safety: if too far from player, teleport back after short timeout.
   Command skill: Focus mode forces all summons to attack one target for 4s.

Build branches:
   Swarm Commander: more summon count, lower per-unit damage, strong with on-hit effects.
   Arcane Familiar: fewer summons, high single-target DPS, better boss pressure.
   Warden Totem: defensive summon that grants shield pulses and slow zones.

Recommended synergy tags:
   Summon + Status: summons apply bleed/burn/slow stacks.
   Summon + Economy: summon kills have chance to drop bonus coin shards.
   Summon + Shield: while shielded, summons gain damage reduction and taunt chance.
   Summon + AoE: summon kill creates mini-explosion or shrapnel burst.

Weaknesses to keep balance:
   Summons do reduced damage to bosses unless specialized by props.
   Summons have pathing downtime in dense obstacles.
   Summons should not fully inherit projectile multipliers without strict caps.

Milestone unlock plan:
   Milestone 1: basic summon follower + respawn system.
   Milestone 2: summon command key + target priority AI.
   Milestone 3: archetype split (Swarm/Familiar/Warden) with unique passives.
   Milestone 4: legendary summon prop that changes your run win condition.


Economy Path and Control Path should be universal side branches that can hybridize with any main archetype.

Status Path / Summoner Path / Lucky Path should be expanded gradually after their core loops are stable.

Boss: Anti-U
================================RARITY=====================================
Rarity tiers & behavior

Let s use numeric rarity for easy tuning:
1 Common: Very frequent in shop, almost never as boss rewards.
2 Uncommon: Medium frequency.
3 Rare: Low frequency early, gets more common in later levels.
4 Epic: Very low chance in shop; most often from bosses.

Rule you wanted:
The higher the rarity, the lower the probability of appearing in the shop 
(but the refresh chance increases as levels increase).

So for the shop we ll:
Give lower base weight to higher rarity.
Give higher growth per level to higher rarity.
================================PROPS======================================
'1. Core Offense Props'

;1.1. Piercing Rounds  ======================================================================='
Effect: Bullets can pass through N enemies, each hit deals full or slightly reduced damage.
Synergy:
Strong with range (bullets travel farther, hit more).
Strong with firerate (more bullets → more multi-hits).
Good vs swarms, slightly weaker vs single bosses.

Rarity: 1
Base Price: $12
Max Level: 5
Level 1/2/3/4/5: pierce_count = +1/+2/+3/+4/+5
Damage falloff per extra pierced target: 0% / 4% / 8% / 12% / 16% (cap 30%).
Rule: piercing checks enemy hit cooldown to avoid multi-hit in the same frame.

;1.2. Ricochet Scope   =========================================================================='
Effect: When a bullet hits an enemy or wall, it can bounce once toward the nearest enemy if exists.
Synergy:
Works nicely with your obstacles (walls turn into combo tools).
Great with crit (ricochets can crit too).
Encourages fighting near obstacles instead of open fields.

Rarity: 2
Base Price: $14
Max Level: 3
Level 1/2/3: ricochet_count = 1/2/3
Retarget cone: 160 deg around impact normal; max retarget range = 4.0 / 4.8 / 5.6 tiles.
Damage per bounce multiplier: 90% / 82% / 75%.

1.3. Bleeding Edge
Effect: Your hits apply a stacking Bleed DoT over 3s (damage and stack cap scale by level).
Synergy:
High firerate builds become DoT machines.
Good vs high-HP bosses (persistent damage even while kiting).
Can interact with other props: e.g.,“Hemorrhage” that increases damage to bleeding targets.

Rarity: 2
Base Price: $17
Max Level: 3
Level 1: bleed_total = 24% bullet_base over 3.0s, max_stacks = 2
Level 2: bleed_total = 36% bullet_base over 3.0s, max_stacks = 3
Level 3: bleed_total = 52% bullet_base over 3.0s, max_stacks = 4
Tick interval: 0.5s.
Boss rule: bleed damage multiplier vs bosses = 0.75.

;1.4. Shrapnel Shells  =========================================================================='
Effect: On enemy death, 25/35/45% to spawn 3-4 small projectiles in random directions.
Synergy:
Insane in big waves (chain-kill feeling).
More effective with crit (shrapnel can crit).
You can add a prop later that upgrades shrapnel size or count.

;1.5. Mark of Vulnerability

Type: Offensive debuff / mark (shop prop)
Rarity: 3
Base Price: $25
Max Level: 3
Core Fantasy
You periodically “expose” a high-priority enemy,
 making them take extra damage from all sources.

Level details:
Level 1: mark_interval = 5.0s, damage_taken_bonus = +15%, mark_duration = 5.0s
Level 2: mark_interval = 4.0s, damage_taken_bonus = +22%, mark_duration = 6.0s
Level 3: mark_interval = 3.0s, damage_taken_bonus = +30%, mark_duration = 7.0s
Targeting priority: boss/elite > ranged > nearest.
UI rule: mark icon pulses every 1.0s while active.


;1.6. Explosive Rounds
Rarity: 2
Base Price: $18
Max Level: 3

Spawn a small AoE explosion centered on that enemy.
Explosion damage is based only on the player base bullet damage (pre-crit).
If the explosion kills another enemy, it chains: 
that enemy also spawns its own explosion with the same stats.
Explosion damage against bosses is 50%.
Explosion does not hurt the player.

Level 1/2/3:

Damage vs normal enemies: 25%/35%/45% of bullet_base
Damage vs bosses: 12.5%/17.5%/22.5% of bullet_base (rounded down in code)
Radius: small/small+/almost 1 tile - about 0.65/0.80/0.95 tiles
Suggest: radius_px = CELL_SIZE * 0.65/0.80/0.95

;1.7. DOT Rounds
Rarity: 2
Base Price: $20
Max Level: 3
Effect: On player bullet hit, apply DoT. Tick interval 0.5s. Damage per tick uses bullet_base (pre-crit).
Bosses take 70% of DoT damage.

Level 1: damage_per_tick = 0.10 * bullet_base, duration = 2.5s (5 ticks), max_stacks = 1
Level 2: damage_per_tick = 0.16 * bullet_base, duration = 3.0s (6 ticks), max_stacks = 1
Level 3: damage_per_tick = 0.22 * bullet_base, duration = 3.5s (7 ticks), max_stacks = 2

VFX: cyan + white spark burst on hit; glow/orbiting particles while active.

;1.8. Ground Spikes
Rarity: 2
Base Price: $18
Max Level: 3
Effect: While moving, leave temporary spikes at your position. Each spike hits once and slows 5% for 1.0s.
Trade-off: each purchase reduces move speed by ~4% (stacking multiplicatively).

Level 1: spike_damage = 0.30 * bullet_base, lifetime = 3.0s, max_active = 6
Level 2: spike_damage = 0.40 * bullet_base, lifetime = 4.0s, max_active = 10
Level 3: spike_damage = 0.50 * bullet_base, lifetime = 5.0s, max_active = 14


'2. Defense & Survival Props'

Not just raw HP—give them interesting defensive patterns.
;2.1. Bone Plating rarity: 2  √  ==========================================================================
Effect: Every 6 seconds, gain 2hp plating. Stacks are unlimited (reset each level). 
Purchase limit 5, once capped, any time you have plating it negates the next hit entirely 
(consuming one stack even if the damage exceeds the plating).
Synergy:
Strong for beginners / melee risk-takers.
Combos with high speed playstyles (you can dash in to grab coins safely).

Base Price: $12
Max Level: 5
Per level: gain +2 plating HP every 6.0s (so +2/+4/+6/+8/+10 per tick at levels 1..5).
At level 5: each hit consumes one plating stack and fully negates that hit.
Speed trade-off in current implementation: each purchase multiplies move speed by 0.98.

2.2. Guardian Charm
Effect: When your HP drops below 30%, gain a temporary shield and speed burst (values scale by level). Long cooldown.
Synergy:
Helps “glass cannon” builds survive mistakes.
Synergizes with speed / positioning to escape on low HP.

Rarity: 2
Base Price: $16
Max Level: 3
Trigger: hp_ratio <= 0.30 and charm_cd <= 0
Level 1: shield = 15, speed_bonus = +15%, duration = 3.0s, cooldown = 30s
Level 2: shield = 24, speed_bonus = +22%, duration = 3.5s, cooldown = 26s
Level 3: shield = 36, speed_bonus = +30%, duration = 4.0s, cooldown = 22s
Rule: Trigger can only occur once every 1.0s even if HP fluctuates around threshold.

2.3. Blood Pact
Effect: Gain large damage multiplier, but reduce max HP (both scale by level).
Synergy:
Obvious synergy with max HP props and heal mechanics.
Encourages high skill players to take risks.

Rarity: 3
Base Price: $20
Max Level: 3
Level 1: damage_mult +18%, max_hp_mult -12%
Level 2: damage_mult +30%, max_hp_mult -20%
Level 3: damage_mult +45%, max_hp_mult -28%
Safety floor: final max HP cannot drop below 35% of base max HP.
UI note: show both values in red/green on purchase confirmation.

2.4. Retaliation Thorns
Effect: Enemies that hit you by contact damage take a flat damage or % of their max HP.
Synergy:
Works well with Bone Plating (you can “intentionally”  take occasional hits).
Encourages tanky, lower-mobility builds.

Rarity: 2
Base Price: $14
Max Level: 3
Level 1: reflect = max(8, 4% enemy_max_hp), internal_cd_per_enemy = 0.50s
Level 2: reflect = max(14, 6% enemy_max_hp), internal_cd_per_enemy = 0.40s
Level 3: reflect = max(22, 8% enemy_max_hp), internal_cd_per_enemy = 0.30s
Boss rule: % max HP component is halved against bosses.
Anti-loop: reflected damage cannot trigger other reflection effects.

;2.5. Aegis Pulse  ==========================================================================
    Trigger condition
Only active while the player has any shield HP:
player.shield_hp > 0 (biome/domain shields, future shield props)
OR carapace_shield_hp > 0 (your Carapace one-time shield)

Effect:
Every cooldown cycle while shield is present, emit a hexagonal force field centered on the player:
Shape: visually rendered as a hexagon; collision can be:
either a circle in code, and you just draw a hex outline, or
All enemies whose hitbox intersects the field take damage.

Rarity: 3
Base Price: $28
Max Level: 5
Level 1/2/3/4/5:

damage = 30% / 45% / 60% / 80% / 100% of enemy max HP
Wave behavior: one expanding pulse; high levels may add visual ripple layers only (no extra hidden damage ticks).
Safety cap: pulse damage to bosses can be clamped to avoid one-cycle kills.

;2.6. Carapace   ==========================================================================
Effect: Add a one time shield for player

Rarity: 1
Base Price: $6
Max Level: None (stackable by purchases)
Per purchase: +20 persistent carapace shield HP.

2.8. Mirror Shell

Rarity: 3
Effect:
While you have shield HP, a percentage of 'RANGED damage' you take is reflected back to the attacker.
At higher levels, reflect % and/or bounce range increases.
Combos:
Mirror Shell + Aegis Pulse
You already want to stay close-ish to enemies for the pulse; reflected shots punish ranged hordes simultaneously.
Mirror Shell + Bone Plating
The more hits you can “eat” with temporary armor, the more reflected damage you dish out.

Max Level: 3
Reflect only applies to ranged/projectile damage.
Level 1: reflect_ratio = 20%, reflect_range = 4.0 tiles
Level 2: reflect_ratio = 32%, reflect_range = 5.0 tiles
Level 3: reflect_ratio = 45%, reflect_range = 6.0 tiles

Effect:
When your shield breaks, it explodes into shards that fly outward like bullets (number of shards & damage scale with level).

Combos:
Carapace + Bone Plating + Shardstorm
Your layers of shield now become ammo when they finally break, turning mistakes into mini-nukes.
Shardstorm + Piercing Rounds / Ricochet Scope / Shrapnel Shells
Shards inherit bullet modifiers: piercing, bouncing, or spawning shrapnel on kill. Shield path suddenly becomes part of the bullet engine.

Base Price: $24
Max Level: 3

Level 1: shard_count = 6, shard_damage = 0.25 * bullet_base, spread = 360 deg
Level 2: shard_count = 9, shard_damage = 0.35 * bullet_base, spread = 360 deg
Level 3: shard_count = 12, shard_damage = 0.45 * bullet_base, spread = 360 deg
Shard speed: 1.15 * player bullet speed, shard lifetime: 0.9s.
Boss rule: shard damage to bosses = 65% of listed value.

'3. Economy & Bandit Interaction Props'

These are great for your Bandit mechanic and the shop fantasy.

;3.1. Lockbox

Rarity: 2
Base Price: $14
Max Level: 4
Protected coin ratio by level: 25% / 40% / 55% / 70%.

Synergy:
Converts the “punishment” enemy into a high-reward target.
Combos with high speed (easier to chase them down) and burst damage.

Base Price: $15
Max Stack: 3 charges
Bounty payout per charge: +18 / +26 / +36 coins (scales by level bracket early/mid/late).

Rarity: 2
Base Price: $12
Max Level: 4
Interest rate by level: 5% / 10% / 15% / 20%
Per-level payout cap: 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 coins

Multiple loans stack debt and use the highest timer; the final wave attempts to clear all remaining debt at once, otherwise you lose 30/35/40% max HP.

Repayment order: Golden Interest -> lockbox protection snapshot -> loan repayment pull.
Anti-feels-bad rule: if player has <= 15 coins, skip scheduled repayment for that wave once.
UI requirement: always show debt left + waves left in both shop and pause possession tooltip.

3.8. Black Market pass

(chance scales with level, e.g., 10/20/30/40/50%).

Base Price: $16

Proc chance by level: 10% / 20% / 30% / 40% / 50%
Anti-loop rule: spawned bonus coin cannot recursively trigger Spoil Splitter.

These change the way the player moves or controls space.

Level effect: +1 auto turret per level.
Base tuning target: turret_damage ~ 33% of player base bullet damage, fire_interval ~0.9s, range ~80% of player range.

'6.Core Paint System '
Tiles can hold temporary “paint” that affects movement and combat. A tile’s paint has:
Owner state: Neutral / Player Paint / Enemy Paint (enemy paint optional for later).
Intensity: 0-1 , starts high when applied, then decays over time. Effects scale with intensity (fresh paint is stronger, faded paint is weaker).
Sources of paint include:
Player movement (trails / footsteps).
Some attacks (projectiles, explosions, AoE splashes).
Boss skills (enemy ink zones).
Props that convert shield, HP, or kills into paint.
Basic rules for Player Paint (future-proof):
While standing on Player Paint:
Small move-speed bonus (respect existing speed cap).
Small attack / damage bonus vs enemies also standing on your paint.
Optional: tiny HP / shield regen and faster “special/ult” meter gain.
Enemy Paint (for later):
Slows the player, may apply chip damage or debuffs (fog, blind, crit reduction), encouraging the player to “reclaim” the ground with their own paint.
Paint always fades over time, keeping the battlefield dynamic instead of permanently covered.
All paint can be covered by other paint, and the new paint will replace the old paint.

6.1. Curing Paint
Path: Core Paint System (OFF - offensive utility)
Rarity: 2 (Common / Uncommon)

Level 2: damage_per_tick = 0.06 * bullet_base, lifetime = 3.0s, radius = 0.78 tiles
Level 3: damage_per_tick = 0.08 * bullet_base, lifetime = 4.0s, radius = 0.90 tiles
Boss rule: paint DoT deals 70% damage to bosses.
Spawn cadence: leave footprint every 0.25s while moving.
Ownership rule: only latest paint owner controls tile effects.
